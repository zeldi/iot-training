Setting Up SAMBA on Raspberry Pi
---

0. Install Samba Server

	$sudo apt install -y samba

1. Create folder to share

	$ mkdir ~/share

2. edit /etc/samba/smb.conf, Scroll down to the very bottom of the smb.conf configuration file and add the following:

----------
.
.
[PiShare] 
comment=Raspi Share 
path=/home/pi/share 
browseable=Yes 
writeable=Yes 
only guest=No 
create mask=0777 
directory mask=0777 
public=no


3. we need to create an SMB (Samba) user so we can connect securely from Windows

$ sudo smbpasswd -a pi

You will be prompted to enter and re-enter a password. Document this password somewhere for future reference.


4.  We are ready to connect to our newly created RasPi file share from Windows!


- Back on your Windows machine, type the Windows key and “R” (Win-R) to launch a run box for typing in commands.

- Enter two backslashes followed by the name of your RasPi machine (i.e. your Hostname) and hit enter. For example:\\raspi

- When prompted for credentials, enter the following:Username: The format to enter here in Windows parlance is the domain\username. For us, our domain will be our RasPi hostname and our user name will be “pi”. Therefore, we will enter: raspi\pi (unless you named your RasPi hostname differently.)
If your Hostname is not raspi, you will obviously enter that instead.Password: (enter the password you created with the smbpasswd command above)

-Voilà! We should now be connected. You can test the file share by creating a text file on the Windows side and verifying that it shows up in the /home/pi/share directory on the RasPi side.
